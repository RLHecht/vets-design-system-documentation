Plain writing can also assist the public in complying with applicable requirements simply because people better understand what they are supposed to do.”

## Top 10 VA plain language standards

Follow these plain language standards to help Veterans and their families find and understand the information they need:

- **Use short sentences.** Try to limit each sentence to one subject and verb when possible. 
- **Use simple words and terms** that are familiar to our primary audience: Veterans and their families.
- **Use active voice.** An action should always be connected to a subject. If there’s no subject taking responsibility for the verb, it’s likely passive voice. 
- **Define complex terms** if you must use them. Add a plain language definition in parentheses immediately following the term or in a separate sentence.
- **Use pronouns** to speak to our audience in a personable and conversational voice. Address the Veteran as an individual with “you”/”your” and refer to VA with “we”/“our.” For Q&As, the Veteran asks the question (use “I”) and VA answers (use “we” and “you”).
- **Use contractions** (“don’t” instead of “do not”) to communicate with our audience in a conversational way. 
- **Don’t use jargon.** This includes bureaucratic and legal language as well as unnecessary acronyms and initialisms.
- **Don’t use idioms.** These can be confusing or not understandable, especially for someone whose first language isn’t English.
- **Avoid or minimize references to branded program names.** Describe the benefit instead. Use “educational and career counseling” to describe Personalized Career Planning and Guidance, PCPG, and Chapter 36.
- **Structure your content** so it’s easy to follow. Instead of long paragraphs, chunk content using hierarchical headings (H2s and H3s), bulleted lists, and process lists.
