Links should tell people what action to take, where to go next, or what information to expect when they select the link.

- Use natural and descriptive language.
- Hyperlink the most relevant word or phrase that describes the purpose and target (destination) of the link.
- Donâ€™t make the link so long that the relevant words get lost.
- Avoid "Click here" as the CTA text.
- Avoid generic CTA links like "Learn more," "See more," and "Read more" by themselves.
- Don't punctuate standalone CTA links. Exception: When the link text is a question.
- If the embedded link text comes at the end of a sentence, don't hyperlink the ending punctuation.
- When a link opens a PDF, YouTube video, XLS or other file format, note that after the link in parentheses. Example: [Download a home toolkit (PDF)](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201503_cfpb_your-home-loan-toolkit-web.pdf) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

### Embedded text links vs. CTA links

__Use embedded text links to cross-link related, helpful information__

Embedded text links are hyperlinks that are part of running text in body copy. We use them to link people to related, but not essential, information. 
- Because too many embedded links can be distracting or overwhelming to readers with traumatic brain injuries or other cognitive impairments, we try to not overuse them. 
- Link information when it will be helpful to the Veteran, and it's related to the subject being discussed, not just for the sake of linking. 

__Use CTA links to call out actions__

CTA links are standalone hyperlinks that are calls to an action, but that don't warrant a [primary button CTA]({{ site.baseurl }}/content-style-guide/button-labels). 

We generally reserve button CTAs to launch an application, to sign in, or other primary, essential action on a page. But there are other kinds of actions that may call for a CTA as a text link, like downloading a form, learning about important information (like eligibility or copay rates, etc.).

__In this example, the link is an action related to the topic, but it isn't the primary CTA, which is to use the online application.__
