{% include _site-in-this-section.html %}

## Examples

<div class="site-showcase">
  {% include_relative html/links.html %}
</div>

{% include snippet.html content='html/links.html' %}

## Usage

### When to use Links

Use a link when you want to:

- Navigate to another page (internal or external)
- Anchor, or jump, to a specific header and section on a page
- Trigger a download such as a PDF
- Play a video
- Make email addresses and phone numbers open the relevant app by clicking or tapping them

### When to consider something else

- Use a [Button]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/button) when you want to make a state change or submit a form. Buttons **do things**, links **go places**. Refer to guidance on [Links vs. buttons]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/link/action#links-vs-buttons)
- When you want to draw attention to an important CTA on the page, such as a link that launches a benefit application, use an [Action link]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/link/action).
- When you want to make a long page of content with two or more H2s easier to navigate, use an [On this page link]({{ site.baseurl }} /components/on-this-page).

### How to use Links

- Links should only open in a new tab if clicking the link will result in the user losing progress or data. Otherwise, links should open in the same window.
- Encode phone and email links with `mailto:` and `tel:`.

## Variations

### Default

{% include component-example.html alt="Example of the default link style." file="/images/components/link/default-link-style-big.png" caption="An example of the default link style." %}

- Usage guidance is above. This is the default style to be used for all links unless otherwise stated in the variations below.
- All links use Source Sans Pro (Regular), underlined, at 16px.
- All links share the same color (`$color-link-default` `#004795`) for icon, link text, and underline. 
- All text links should be underlined. This is especially important for low-vision users. (Exception: [side navigation links]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/sidenav) should not be underlined.)

### Active link

{% include component-example.html alt="Example of the active link style." file="/images/components/link/active-link-style-big.png" caption="An example of the default link style." %}
{% include snippet.html content='html/active-link.html' %}

- For links that have less hierarchy than an Action Link, we recommend using an Active Link. Active Links can be accompanied by a right-facing chevron icon for more emphasis. 
- Active links can be seen on [Hub pages]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/templates/hub#example)
- Active link text is bold.

### PDF download link

{% include component-example.html alt="Example of the PDF download link style." file="/images/components/link/download-link-en.png" caption="An example of the PDF download link in English." %}
{% include snippet.html content='html/pdf-download-link.html' %}

- Use for PDF download links. The download icon is optional.
- Structure: fa-download icon + 8px margin + Link text (PDF, page count)

### Video link - Descriptive

{% include component-example.html alt="Example of the video link descriptive style." file="/images/components/link/video-descriptive-link.png" caption="An example of the video descriptive link in English." %}
{% include snippet.html content='html/video-descriptive-link.html' %}

* Use when linking directly to a YouTube video.
* Structure: fa-play-circle icon + 8px margin + Video link text

### Video link - Channel

{% include component-example.html alt="Example of the video link channel style." file="/images/components/link/video-channel-link.png" caption="An example of the video descriptive link in English." %}
{% include snippet.html content='html/video-channel-link.html' %}

* Use when linking to a YouTube channel.
* Structure: fa-youtube icon + 8px margin + YouTube channel name

## Content considerations

{% include content/links.md %}

## Accessibility considerations

- **Material honesty**: Do not style a link to look or behave like a button ([material honesty](https://alistapart.com/article/material-honesty-on-the-web/)).
- **Keyboard navigation**: The user must be able to navigate to links using the Tab key and activate links using the Enter key.
- **Purpose and target**: Without a purpose and target, everyone-- but especially screen reader users-- will struggle to understand where they may be routed off to.
